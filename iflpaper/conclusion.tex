\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
Giving parallel constructs a deterministic semantics makes reasoning about parallel programs substantially easier.  In this work we have shown how we can extend the expressiveness of Manticore by adding IVars and still be able to guarantee deterministic execution.  We have formalized the semantics of this extended language and provided a proof of its correctness using the Coq proof assistant.  

For our preliminary implementation we have tried to remain faithful to the formal semantics as much as possible to ensure correctness without worrying too much about performance.  In the immediate future we plan on fine tuning our implementation of the runtime system in Manticore to improve efficiency and perform a more thorough evaluation.  This idea of combining speculative parallelism with IVars is a new programming model that has not been explored elsewhere so coming up with interesting benchmark programs is also a bit of a challenge and something we look to explore further in the future.  Lastly, we believe it would be interesting in generalizing our approach to the LVars programming model.  As mentioned in the previous section, this is an extension of the IVars model that permits multiple writes to shared references, so extending both our implementation and our formal semantics presents some interesting challenges.
