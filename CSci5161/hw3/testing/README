To run the automated tests, here is what you should do:

1. Edit the first three lines of the runsml files to indicate the 
   correct directories for the source code, the test cases directory 
   and the current directory. (Typically, you will want to leave the 
   last as is.)

   Remember that you should not use ~ in paths. You can use .., though. 

   Remember also that the test cases for which we have generated outputs 
   are all those in the syntax-and-sem-analysis directory, so it is only
   your relevant path to this directory that you should use for the 
   automated testing. 

2. Make sure you do not have a file named parse.sml.bak in the code 
   directory that you want to preserve; if you do, move it somewhere else
   (or change the lines in runsml that make use of this name to save a
    copy of the original parse.sml file).

3. Run ./runsml. This will run the driver for all files in the testcases 
directory. The outputs will be compared with the correct results using the 
unix diff command.

4. If you don't want to run the test for all files, remove the line in
runsml which creates a listing of the files in the testing directory in 
the file "files.list" and create your own  "files.list" with the names 
of the testcases you need. The diff will show some errors like "only 
present in correct_results".  This is because now we are producing the 
results of only the files in "files.list".
