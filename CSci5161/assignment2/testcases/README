There are a few different kinds of tests that are useful depending on which
phase of compiler writing you are currently at. In the beginning, during 
syntactic (lexer and parser) and semantic analysis (type checking, escape 
calculation etc) the syntax-and-sem-analysis tests are probably most useful.
Later, when generating intermediate code, the test cases in translation may 
be relevant. Eventually, when testing the MIPS code that is generated, the 
tests in full-compiler-tests that actually contain meaningful programs that
should produce recognizable results would be useful.

Added a file more_comments.tig to the top level directory for testing the
lexer for its treatment of comments; checking if it understands that 
code in comments do not get tokenized and also provides a suitable error
message for the case where a comment has not been closed by the end-of-file.
